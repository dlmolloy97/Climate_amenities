After reading an article on the subjectivity of the USDA's rankings of American counties by scenery and climate, the author hypothesised that counties ranked lower on this scale would experience less severe impacts from the warming climate. This was based on the USDA's criteria for the ranking, which favoured warmer counties located by the sea or near mountains--both geographic features correlated with natural disasters driven by climate change. The results did not support this hypothesis, as more attractive counties were onlt marginally more likely to experience climate change-related damage. It was possible, however, to isolate regional trends in the *type* of risk faced by counties.
